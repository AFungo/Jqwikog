## How to Contribute to jqwik

Please, please, please add your suggestion, ideas and bug reports using the project's
[issue tracker on github](https://github.com/jlink/jqwik/issues).

Of course, you are also invited to send in [pull requests](https://github.com/jlink/jqwik/pulls). 
Be prepared, though, that I'll be picky about what I accept, since the initial phase of a project 
is crucial for shaping the mid and long-term future of a project's design and architecture.
As a matter of course, never forget to include example- or property-based-tests together with
your pull request.

If you want to become a long-term supporter, maintainer or committer for __jqwik__
please [get in touch](mailto:business@johanneslink.net).
